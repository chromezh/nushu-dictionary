<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><em>Nushu</em> (女书) is a mysterious script used exclusively among woman in Jiangyong County of Southern China. It is handed down by mother to daughter among the Han and Yao people from generation to generation in Jiangyong County and its adjacent areas, becoming a unique cultural phenomenon in human history.</p>
<p><em>Nushu</em> characters are rhomboidal in shape, slim in style and imaginative in the form. The total amount of <em>Nushu</em> characters being discovered is up to two thousands, all of which contain solely four kinds of chokes – dotted, vertical, oblique and arcuate.</p>
<p>Although the style of <em>Nushu</em> is derived from Chinese characters, they are not absolutely corresponded. Different from Chinese Characters, <em>Nushu</em> is a syllabic script, for every character of it represents either a syllable, or a group of syllables that are similar in pronunciation. Meanwhile, since <em>Nushu</em> is not only being written, but also being embroidered to clothes and flower belts as decorations, it accommodates to be curved in shape.</p>
<p>The earilest record of <em>Nushu</em> is the Diaomu coin issued by Taiping Tian Guo during the Xianfeng Period in Qing Dynasty. The <em>Nushu</em> characters “women all over the world are sisters in a whole family” were carved in the back side of the coin.</p>
<p>In 1982, Professor Gong Zhebing from Wuhan University discovered <em>Nushu</em> in Jiangyong County, Hunan Province. This discovery caused a sensation throughout the world. Experts and scolars at home and abroad leave for Jiangyong to do investigation, learning and discovery.</p>
