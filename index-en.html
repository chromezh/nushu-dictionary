<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCshu"><em>Nushu</em></a> (女书) is a mysterious script used exclusively among women in Jiangyong County of Southern China. It is handed down by mother to daughter among the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese">Han</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao_people">Yao</a> people from generation to generation in Jiangyong County and its adjacent areas, becoming a unique cultural phenomenon in human history.</p>
<p><em>Nushu</em> characters are rhomboidal in shape, slim in style and imaginative in the form. The total amount of the characters being discovered is up to two thousands, all of which contain solely four kinds of chokes – dotted, vertical, oblique and arcuate.</p>
<p>Although <em>Nushu</em> is derived from Chinese characters, there is no absolute correspondence. Being different from Chinese Characters, <em>Nushu</em> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary">syllabic script</a>, for every character of it represents either a syllable, or a group of syllables that are similar in pronunciation. Meanwhile, the characters accommodate to be curved in shape, because they are also embroidered on clothes and flower belts besides being written down.</p>
<p>The earliest record of <em>Nushu</em> script is the Diaomu coin issued by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Heavenly_Kingdom">Taiping Heavenly Kingdom</a> during the Xianfeng Period in Qing Dynasty. The <em>Nushu</em> characters “women all over the world are sisters in one family” were carved in the back side of the coin.</p>
<p>In 1982, Professor Gong Zhebing (宫哲兵) from Wuhan University discovered <em>Nushu</em> in Jiangyong County, Hunan Province. The discovery caused a sensation throughout the world. Experts and scholars at home and abroad leave for Jiangyong to do investigation, learning and discovery. In recent years, projects for rescuing and protecting the <em>Nushu</em> culture are being actively carried out in Yongzhou City. People carry forward and promote the culture by building <em>Nushu</em> villages and <em>Nushu</em> museums, making <em>Nushu</em> craftsmanship and developing <em>Nushu</em> culture industry. <a href="https://unicode.org/wg2/docs/n3340.pdf"><em>Proposal for encoding Nüshu in the SMP of the UCS</em></a>, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=S1ZmGQAACAAJ"><span data-index="女书用字比较"><em>Comparison of the characters used to write Nüshu</em></span></a> and several other documents are made by a group of student from Tsinghua University. They are also the representatives to submit the encoding proposal.</p>
<p><em>Nushu</em> is used to record the local dialect. It could be written on cotton books as wedding gifts, which are called “third day missives” (三朝书), or written on fans, handkerchiefs and papers. It is also embroidered on handkerchiefs. Women in the local areas used to do the needlework together, reading, singing and teaching <em>Nushu</em>. Such activity forms a special <em>Nushu</em> culture.</p>
