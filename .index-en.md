## Introduction

[_Nushu_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCshu) (女书) is a mysterious script used exclusively among woman in Jiangyong County of Southern China. It is handed down by mother to daughter among the [Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese) and [Yao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao_people) people from generation to generation in Jiangyong County and its adjacent areas, becoming a unique cultural phenomenon in human history.

_Nushu_ characters are rhomboidal in shape, slim in style and imaginative in the form. The total amount of the characters being discovered is up to two thousands, all of which contain solely four kinds of chokes -- dotted, vertical, oblique and arcuate.

Although _Nushu_ is derived from Chinese characters, there is no absolute correspondence. Being different from Chinese Characters, _Nushu_ is a [syllabic script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary), for every character of it represents either a syllable, or a group of syllables that are similar in pronunciation. Meanwhile, the characters accommodate to be curved in shape, because they are also embroidered on clothes and flower belts besides being written down.

The earliest record of _Nushu_ script is the Diaomu coin issued by [Taiping Heavenly Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Heavenly_Kingdom) during the Xianfeng Period in Qing Dynasty. The _Nushu_ characters "women all over the world are sisters in one family" were carved in the back side of the coin.

In 1982, Professor Gong Zhebing (宫哲兵) from Wuhan University discovered _Nushu_ in Jiangyong County, Hunan Province. The discovery caused a sensation throughout the world. Experts and scholars at home and abroad leave for Jiangyong to do investigation, learning and discovery. In recent years, projects for rescuing and protecting the _Nushu_ culture are being actively carried out in Yongzhou City. People carry forward and promote the culture by building _Nushu_ villages and _Nushu_ museums, making _Nushu_ craftsmanship and developing _Nushu_ culture industry. [_Proposal for encoding Nüshu in the SMP of the UCS_](https://unicode.org/wg2/docs/n3340.pdf), [<span index="女书用字比较">_Comparison of the characters used to write Nüshu_</span>](https://books.google.com/books?id=S1ZmGQAACAAJ) and several other documents are made by a group of student from Tsinghua University. They are also the representatives to submit the encoding proposal.

_Nushu_ is used to record the local dialect. It could be written on cotton books as wedding gifts, which are called "third day missives" (三朝书), or written on fans, handkerchiefs and papers. It is also embroidered on handkerchiefs. Women in the local areas used to do the needlework together, reading, singing and teaching _Nushu_. Such activity forms a special _Nushu_ culture.
